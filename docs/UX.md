# UX Design 

## Layout

#### Desktop View
* Equal ratio for locations list and map doesn't look good in medium width (for tablet), so I've split it with 5-7 ratio for medium width.
* The hight of each column is set to the height of the screen, to have an app look-and-feel. 


#### Mobile View
* The height of the list is unlimited, or we will end up having a double-scroller, which is a bad UX design decision. 
* A back-to-card button is added after the map to take the user to the originally clicked card.
